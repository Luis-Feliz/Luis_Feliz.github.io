              Made in Unity for an Internship with Saint Luke's University Hospital 
              as a leader in a team of 6.
              <br><br> 
              Made the animations and helped lead a team of 6 in the engineering, 
              designing, and animating for a client as a means to give an educational 
              VR experience to children and adults who are curious about certain 
              conditions and how they affect the body.

              Made in Unity for a 2D Game Development Course as the lead in a team of 4.
              <br><br> 
              Lead the charge for the code in a majority of the game including the 
              movement, scene transitioning, inventory, and enemy spawning code.
              Helped create Music, SFX, and animations for paralaxing the background 
              trees alongside the train art.

              Made in Unity for a 3D Game Development Course.
              <br><br> 
              Although not fully complete, contains an inventory and combat system fully 
              coded by me! Containing a turn-based battle system, inventory, and switching cameras 
              inside and outside combat to see and play the games from different angles.

            <p>
              Made in Unity as a side project during the summer inspired by the mobile game craze of Subway Surfers.
              <br><br> 
              Created obstacles that instantiate at random once the platforms reach a certain level. The game would 
              progressively get faster the more points and coins you collect. The game is incomplete, however, the 
              mechanics are fleshed out. Instantiation of platforms also helped in the creation of the paralaxing 
              in OneWayTicket.

              Made in Unity for a game jam being run in my college.
              <br><br> 
              Created movable blocks that become still when you begin to escape. The puzzle revolving around 
              finding the easiest way to move from point A to point B without getting hit by the pellets that 
              the blocks let out.
