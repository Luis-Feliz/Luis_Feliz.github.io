              A coding project made in college, The main purpose was to provide a way to have 
              the frequecy of one's voice be translated into a divice you could place your hands 
              on, in speaking loudly to a mic, the device would react and respond by moving aroind 
              depending on how loud you were, thus you were FEELING your own SOUND.
