              here, it is being worked on as we speak and will be fully fleshed out soon.

              A coding project made in college, The main purpose was to provide a way to have 
              the frequency of one's voice be translated into a device you could place your hands 
              on, in speaking loudly to a mic, the device would react and respond by moving around 
              depending on how loud you were, thus you were FEELING your SOUND.

              A coding project made in college, The main purpose was to continue the team of 
              sound-baised coding projects. This project consisted of having the camera 
              using body recognition software made in MIT to help show your body as a silhouette 
              and have it be affected by how loud you are using the code I helped make from my 
              previous project. The louder you were, the more the silhouette would beging to 
              inflate right on the screen.
