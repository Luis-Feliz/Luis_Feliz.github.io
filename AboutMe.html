          <h1> Bio </h1>
          <p>
            Luis's approach towards Game Development is characterised by his 
            deep love and respect towards the medium. He has grown to pay attention to 
            every single portion of the game design process from the intensive coding 
            engines to the musical both in song and SFX. He prides himself to be a grand 
            jack of all trades and believes that the best games don't come from just one 
            thing done perfect but the combination off all mediums inside a game working 
            in symphony with one another.
            
            Born in Dominican Republic and moving between there and New York, Luis grew 
            up being surrounded with many different cultures and experances that has 
            shaped his form of expression. In the midst of his growth, he found love in 
            both games and stories, of which he was infatuated by how they can invoke 
            strong and enaging emotions with their reader/player that have moved him and 
            inspired him to create.

            He now yearns to create games that have moved and bring out emotions of 
            others the same way they have done to him.
