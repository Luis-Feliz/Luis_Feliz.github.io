          <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Bio </h1>
          <p>
            Luis's approach toward Game Development is characterized by his deep love 
            and respect for the medium. He has grown to pay attention to every single 
            portion of the game design process from the intensive coding engines to the 
            music both in song and SFX. He prides himself to be a grand jack of all trades 
            and believes that the best games don't come from just one thing done perfectly 
            but the combination of all mediums inside a game working in symphony with 
            one another. 
            <br> <br>
            Born in the Dominican Republic and moving between there and New York, Luis 
            grew up surrounded by many different cultures and experiences that have shaped 
            his form of expression. Amid his growth, he found love in both games and 
            stories, of which he was infatuated by how they can invoke strong and engaging 
            emotions in their readers/players that have moved him and inspired him to 
            create.
            <br> <br>
            He now yearns to create games that have moved and bring out the emotions 
            of others the same way they have done to him.
            <br> <br>
            Recently, Luis has just graduated from Kutztown University of Philidelphia as 
            the very first Game Development in KU history and is eagerly preparing and 
            applying to seek out employment to further his dream along.
